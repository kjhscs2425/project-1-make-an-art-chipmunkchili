# Project Proposal

1. Roughly, what will your drawing look like
    It will be a star-like shape, but with more than the usual number of points.

2. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?
    One variable could be the number of points in the star. Another variable could be the length of each line.

3. Where is there repetition in your drawing?
    The whole star will be made out of equivalent angles, repeated a certain number of times to complete the star. If I have time, I could also make the same star but in different colors, with slightly different angles.

4. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?
    The parts that make up the star will be the angles mentioned above.

5. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?
    I could use the loop variable of a for loop to identify how many points of the star have been drawn so far. This would be helpful because the points are repeated multiple times, depending on the number of points desired.
